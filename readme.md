# Sport Club App
Developing a sustainable future for local & small sport clubs who need to communicate effectively with their supporters and give supporters way to give back to their club.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive project for developing Expo applications with Supabase as the backend. It integrates various technologies such as Expo Router for navigation, Tailwind CSS for styling, React-Hook-Form for form handling, Zod for schema validation, and TypeScript for type safety. By leveraging these powerful tools, this starter template provides a robust foundation for building modern, scalable, and efficient mobile applications.
